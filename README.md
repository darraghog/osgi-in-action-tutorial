Fancyfoods tutorial code

This is source code implementing the 'fancyfoods' tutorial in the Manning "OSGi in Action" book.

The code runs on a standard Mac OSX PC, but should work in other PCs too.

The repository started roughly half-way through the book, and by the time it is done should reflect the complete fancyfoods example application.

The complete source code for the tutorials can be found as a resource on manning.com, but this code base starts a development environment from scratch, with the toolchain evolving as the tutorial progresses.

The examples do not use bndtools.
